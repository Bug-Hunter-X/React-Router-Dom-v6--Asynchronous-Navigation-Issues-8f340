The solution involves ensuring the navigation occurs after the asynchronous operation completes successfully.  Using async/await or promises ensures the navigation function is called only once the asynchronous process has finished.  Here is the corrected code: 

```javascript
import { useNavigate } from 'react-router-dom';

async function MyComponent() {
  const navigate = useNavigate();

  const handleSubmit = async (event) => {
    event.preventDefault();
    try {
      const response = await fetch('/api/submit'); // Your API call
      if (response.ok) {
        navigate('/success');
      } else {
        // Handle error
      }
    } catch (error) {
      // Handle error
    }
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      {/* Your form elements */}
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  );
}

export default MyComponent;
```
This approach makes sure that the navigation happens only after the API call is complete and successful.
